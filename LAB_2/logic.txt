Choose Y = ax + b + N(0,1)  # Choose Noise which have mean = 0 and variance 1 
X = U[0,10] # this U is uniform 
S_n = {(xi, yi)}^n_i=1    # n = 0.01

this a just learning model so implement this thing in python 

after finding this do forward pass and backward pass and then compare waights 

x + [w] = b = L # L loss and b Bais 

Now make a perceptron , using Scipy Make Blobs , this is next question of this lab
