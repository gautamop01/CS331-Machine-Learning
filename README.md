# LAB 1
Forward and Backward Pass and after that do comparison 

# LAB 2
1) Choose Y = ax + b + N(0,1)  # Choose Noise which have mean = 0 and variance 1 
X = U[0,10] # this U is uniform 
S_n = {(xi, yi)}^n_i=1    # n = 0.01

2) BONUS PROBLEM
Make a perceptron , using Scipy Make Blobs , this is Bonus question of this lab
