# The Iris dataset is typically used for 
# classification tasks, but you can adapt 
# the operations for regression or 
# classification based on your specific goal.
# You would need to modify the output layer
# and loss accordingly. The softmax layer 
# and cross-entropy loss are commonly 
# used for multi-class classification.
